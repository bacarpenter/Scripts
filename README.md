# pyScripts

Scripts that I use regularly on my mac!

## Usage

Usage is simple, just
1. Download the repo onto your machine
2. Install the requirements with `pip install -r  requirements.txt`
3. Run `python3 scripts.py`!

**Note**: On my machine, I have pyScripts/ in my home directory, and a sym link of scripts.py in my home dir also.

You may need to make other changes to get it working!
